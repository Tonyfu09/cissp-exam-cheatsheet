# CISSP Domain 4 â€” Communication and Network Security

## Description  
CISSP Domain 4, **Communication and Network Security**, focuses on designing, protecting, and managing secure network architectures and communications.  
It covers principles like **network protocols, secure network components, transmission security, and communication channels** to:  

- **Protect data in transit** through encryption, VPNs, and secure protocols  
- **Prevent network attacks** by implementing firewalls, IDS/IPS, and segmentation  
- **Ensure secure network design** that supports confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- **Support compliance** with organizational security policies and regulatory requirements

## Scenario List  



## 4.1 Assess and implement secure design principles in network architectures
Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet service will be the best option in this scenario
Geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite internet service would offer slower throughput with higher latency compared to LEO
DNSSEC uses certificates to perform mutual authentication between DNS servers, and thus public key infrastructure (PKI) is needed to provide and support those certificates. 

5G networks
Mutual authentication capabilities
Enhanced subscriber identity protection

What mades SAN inability to recover file.
It could be the depulication. As multiple copies of a file with a pointer to only one copy.
