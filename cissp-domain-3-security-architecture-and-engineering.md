# CISSP Domain 3 — Security Architecture and Engineering

## Description  
CISSP Domain 3, **Security Architecture and Engineering**, forms the foundation for designing and implementing secure systems.  
It covers principles like **security models, architecture frameworks, cryptography, and physical security** to:  

- **Protect assets and information** by enforcing confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- **Ensure systems are resilient** against attacks and vulnerabilities  
- **Support compliance** with organizational policies, laws, and regulations

---

## 3.1 Research, implement, and manage engineering processes using secure design principles
- **Security by Design** – Embed security from the start of system development  
- **Privacy by Design (PbD)** – Incorporate privacy and data protection proactively  
- **Zero Trust Model** – Assume all devices, users, and networks are untrusted by default  
- **Segregation of Duties / Two-Person Control** – Require at least two authorized individuals to perform critical operations to reduce risk of fraud or error

---

## 3.6 Select and determine cryptographic solutions
- **Encryption algorithm modes**:
  - **ECB (Electronic Codebook)** – Simple but vulnerable to pattern analysis  
  - **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)** – Stronger; each block depends on the previous block  
  - **GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)** – Provides confidentiality and integrity
- **Digital Signature Standard (DSS)** – Approves three encryption algorithms for digital signatures:
  1. **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)**  
  2. **RSA**  
  3. **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**  

---

## 3.7 Understand methods of cryptanalytic attacks
- **Side-Channel Attack** – Exploits physical implementation (timing, power consumption, EM leaks)  
- **Brute-Force Attack** – Exhaustively tries all possible keys  
- **Timing Attack** – Measures execution time to infer secrets  
- **Fault Injection Attack** – Intentionally induces errors to reveal information

Security Measure
Two-person control, also known as the two-person rule or two-person integrity, is a security measure that requires at least two authorized individuals to be present and active for a specific task or to gain access to critical material to prevent a single person from acting alone
