## Description  
CISSP Domain 3, **Security Architecture and Engineering**, forms the foundation for designing and implementing secure systems.  
It covers principles like **security models, architecture frameworks, cryptography, and physical security** to:  

- **Protect assets and information** by enforcing confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- **Ensure systems are resilient** against attacks and vulnerabilities  
- **Support compliance** with organizational policies, laws, and regulations

## 3.1 Research, implement and manage engineering processes using secure design principles
