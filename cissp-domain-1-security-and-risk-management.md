## Description  
CISSP Domain 1, **Security and Risk Management**, forms the foundation of information security.  
It covers principles like the **CIA triad**, **security governance**, and **risk management concepts** to:  
- Protect organizational assets  
- Ensure compliance with laws and regulations  
- Maintain ethical conduct


##1.3 Evaluate and apply security governance principles
The asset owner
The custodian
The user

## Scenario List  

1. When conducting a **risk assessment**, the team should discuss these metrics: **ALE, SLE, ARO, EF**.  

| Term        | Definition | Functional Use |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **ALE** (Annualized Loss Expectancy) | Expected yearly loss from a risk | Helps quantify total financial risk |
| **SLE** (Single Loss Expectancy)     | Cost of a single incident | Measures the impact per occurrence |
| **ARO** (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) | Estimated frequency of an incident per year | Helps predict likelihood of risk |
| **EF** (Exposure Factor)             | Percentage of asset value lost due to incident | Shows proportional damage to asset |

---

2. Principle that for exercise in a particular situation to avoid causing harm to others, serving as the standard for determining negligence in legal case

| Term        | Definition | Functional Use |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Due Care** | Acting responsibly to avoid causing harm to others (the “prudent person” rule) | Demonstrates that reasonable protective measures were taken |
| **Due Diligence** | Ongoing process of ensuring policies, procedures, and controls are maintained | Shows continuous monitoring and oversight of risks |

---

3. Metrics for reducing risk  

| Term | Definition | Functional Use |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Risk Avoidance** | Eliminate the risk source entirely | Example: Disable a vulnerable service |
| **Risk Mitigation** | Reduce the likelihood or impact | Example: Apply patches, add firewalls |
| **Risk Transfer** | Shift the risk to another party | Example: Insurance, outsourcing |
| **Risk Acceptance** | Acknowledge and accept the residual risk | Example: Low impact and low probability events |
| **Risk Sharing** | Divide responsibility among parties | Example: Joint ventures, partnerships |

---


4. Types of intellectual property protection

| Term        | Definition | Functional Use |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Patents** | Protect inventions or processes | Prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention |
| **Trademarks** | Protect brand names, logos, and symbols | Helps distinguish goods/services in the marketplace |
| **Copyrights** | Protect creative works like books, music, software | Grants exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, or display |
| **Trade Secrets** | Protect confidential business information | Prevents disclosure of proprietary methods, formulas, or processes |

---

5. Security Goal — The **CIA Triad**  

| Term | Definition | Functional Use |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Confidentiality (C)** | Ensures information is accessible only to authorized individuals | Protects against unauthorized disclosure |
| **Integrity (I)** | Ensures accuracy and completeness of data | Prevents unauthorized modification |
| **Availability (A)** | Ensures reliable and timely access to data and systems | Prevents downtime and denial-of-service |

---

## STRIDE Model  
Used for **threat modeling** to identify security risks:

| Category | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **S** – Spoofing | Pretending to be someone else | Fake login or identity |
| **T** – Tampering | Modifying data or code | Changing parameters in transit |
| **R** – Repudiation | Denying actions without evidence | Lack of logs or audit trails |
| **I** – Information Disclosure | Unauthorized access to data | Data leak or eavesdropping |
| **D** – Denial of Service | Disrupting system availability | Flooding or resource exhaustion |
| **E** – Elevation of Privilege | Gaining unauthorized access rights | Privilege escalation attack |

---

## RMF (Risk Management Framework) Phases  

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Categorize** | Determine system and data sensitivity based on impact (FIPS 199) |
| **2. Select** | Choose baseline security controls (NIST SP 800-53) |
| **3. Implement** | Apply the selected security controls |
| **4. Assess** | Evaluate effectiveness through testing or audit |
| **5. Authorize** | Management accepts residual risk and grants operation approval |
| **6. Monitor** | Continuously track control performance and emerging risks |

---

## DREAD Risk Rating System  
Used to **prioritize and rate risk** by scoring each factor (1–10):

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Damage Potential** | How severe would the damage be? |
| **Reproducibility** | How easily can the attack be reproduced? |
| **Exploitability** | How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability? |
| **Affected Users** | How many users would be impacted? |
| **Discoverability** | How easy is it to discover the vulnerability? |

> Total Risk = (D + R + E + A + D) / 5

## Security Control Assessment (SCA)
In the context of **1.10**, the SCA evaluates whether implemented security controls:  
- Are **properly implemented**,  
- **Operate as intended**, and  
- **Produce the desired security outcomes**.

---

## Key Regulations & Standards

### FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
- U.S. law protecting **student education records**.
- Grants students rights over their records (access, correction, some control of disclosure).
- Applies to schools receiving funds from the U.S. Department of Education.
- **Penalties**: Can lose federal funding (no direct monetary fines to individuals).

---

### HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- U.S. law for **healthcare data protection**.
- Safeguards **PHI (Protected Health Information)** and **ePHI (Electronic PHI)**.
- Key rules:
  - **Privacy Rule** (use/disclosure of PHI)
  - **Security Rule** (admin, physical, technical safeguards)
